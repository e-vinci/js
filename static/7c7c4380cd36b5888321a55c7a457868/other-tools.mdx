import jsFile from "../other-resources/js.pdf"

This Framework based on Gatsby offers other facilities.
Here is an example of a link to an internal file in other-resources :
<a href={jsFile}>Amazing file</a>

Another simpler way to include a link to a File :
<LinkFile name="js2.pdf" target="_blank">Simple link just by giving the name of the file</LinkFile>
